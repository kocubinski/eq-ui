Release notes:

	. This is a very simple UI, nothing fancy i would say, except for a pair of modifications.

	  My goal was to preserve the original look and feel and get rid of the things that annoy me the most, like filigrees, rounded corners and those big and intrusive titlebars that are everywhere wasting precious space.

	  Now i think the windows are much easier to organize in screen, in most cases they are smaller and clearer.

	  I reworked some other windows too, hope you like the modifications.


	. Please, keep in mind that this UI is optimized for the Windows default font "Segoe UI".


	. If you want to try the windows layout as shown in the screenshots, copy the file "UI_VoktarUI_Solo.ini" to the game installation directory, then you can switch to it in-game via: Options Window > General Tab > Copy Layout.
